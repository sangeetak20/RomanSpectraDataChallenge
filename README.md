# Overview

Training and development opportunities are critical for Spectroscopic Probes of Quantitative Reionization (SPQR) simulated data and software tools to be effectively used by the wider astronomy community. To this end, we organized data challenges providing participants with an opportunity to work with high fidelity simulated observations and to gain experience in analyzing spectroscopic data. These include tutorials in slitless spectroscopy. These will be open to individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences. We currently plan to implement these as splinter sessions in conjunction with American Astronomical Society (AAS) meetings, and will make these sessions fully hybrid to enable broad participation by astronomers who are not at the AAS.

**Data Challenge 1**

This subdirectory is made to guide a user through degrading spectra to Roman Grism resolution and be able to calculate line flux and estimate redshift from the methods used here. 

The notebook `RomanDataChallenge.ipynb` walks the user through these goals and gives them an opportunity to also use spectra that have been degraded to Roman Grism resolution 

The folder `spectra` contains the template spectra used in the notebook as well as galaxy spectra for the user to use in the notebook. 

**Data Challenge 2** 

This subdirectory contains two demos where the Jupyter notebooks will guide you on how to extract 1D spectra from a 2D spectra.
